Trinity Admin Bundle
====================

For removing sidebar messages user has to have this right granted:
-ROLE_ADMIN_SIDEBAR_MSG_REMOVE
otherwise he will not see removing button.

In the application (Necktie/Venice) has to be route for path 'ajax_remove-sidebar-msg'.
This is called from JS, if none path exist button doesn't work.
